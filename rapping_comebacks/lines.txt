really?
gg!
wow! soo original!
rapping worse than the horse
you're soo good at raping!
my grandma used to rap better
comeback the size of a peanut
im a robot dude
are you saying that to me?
my name is Eminem and i like to rap
your lines are soo cold my cpu started to shiver
the rhyme tried but you died
Weak spit, I delete it

Nice try, you still fry

Your bars? Dust. No trust

Dead flow, let it go

Your rhyme? Tragic. Mine? Magic

You spit fear, I spit gear

Soft rap, full cap

Your verse? Broke. You joke

Bad beat, take a seat

You drop shame, I drop flame

Low skill, no chill

Whack tone, sit down, clone

Tiny bark, I’m full dark

Your line? Weak grind

That bar’s trash, quick crash

You flatter? No matter, I shatter

Short burst, you cursed

Your rhyme? Dirt. I convert

Weak attack, fade to black

You talk loud, zero crowd
