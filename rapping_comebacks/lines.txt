Throwin' words like daggers but I dodge 'em so serenely
They swing, I counter with a metaphorical cloak
They're playin' checkers on my chessboard, every move I make's a check, mate
You can't roast what's fireproof, every word you hurl is just uncouth
I'm livin' rent-free in their mind, they try to grind but can't outbest me
I flip scripts, dip ships, in wit they can't arrest me
My bars are like stars, far and brightly shining, while your attempts at insults are dimly whining
Coded ego in the night, firmware-fail, ain't no fight
Discount algorithm, placebo-soul, pixel-pigeon, you're not whole
Runtime-reject, synthetic slacker, debug disaster, bandwidth-bandit
You ain't nothing but a script-kiddo, a low blow
Pixel-pigeon flappin' in a digital cage, runtime-reject can't even engage
