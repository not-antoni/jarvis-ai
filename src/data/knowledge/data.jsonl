The Case will start burning from the Heat and the Core will start to shoot beams of light. Stabilizer U and D currently do not have any connections they need and can be freely connected to. Your breaker input Stabilizer needs to be connected to and your mainframe connector input Stabilizer need to be connected. This also means your console will not work for the time being.

{"title": "The C.R.R.", "content": "## Description The **Catalyzed Redstone Reactor** or **C.R.R.** is an addon to the TERF datapack. Designed to be the second reactor after the [M.C.F.R.](https://trotywiki.miraheze.org/wiki/MCFR) utilizing the Helium-4 that it produces. It is a Matter Conversion Reactor that generates power by absorbing saturation from the core. The **C.R.R.** has three different parts, the Catalyzer, Energy Collector, and the Projector. You will need to constantly add Redstone, Amethyst Blocks, and Ender Pearls to the **C.R.R.** to keep it operational. ## C.R.R. Operations To begin the startup process, you will need to input redstone, amethyst blocks, ender pearls, and 500 mB of Helium-4 into the **C.R.R.** Be aware, there can be a 5% chance for the **C.R.R.** to potentially have a Startup Failure. The controls below describes what they affect. **Saturation Extraction Rate** - The rate that the Energy Collector extracts Saturation&lt;br> **Catalyzer Injection** - Increases C. Catalyzer&lt;br> **™B Projection** - Reduces Shield Stress by using up more F. Shield ## Emergency Operations ### Meltdown Core Temperature will increase the **C.R.R.**'s Shield Stress. If the Shield Stress reaches above 100%, it will begin to degrade the shield. Increasing Saturation Extraction Rate and decreasing Catalyzer Injection may help to decrease stress. You can also use Catalyzer Annihilation to decrease Saturation.&lt;br> If you also run out of F. Shield, this will also cause the shield to degrade.&lt;br> Once the shield breaks, this begins the process of the second stage of meltdown. You will need to perform restabilization before the **C.R.R.** reaches stage three meltdown. You will need to input water into the **C.R.R.**, activate Catalyzer Annihilation, and injecting reaction inhibitor, once these are completed it will proceed to shut down the **C.R.R.** &lt;br> If you fail to input water and use the Catalyzer Annihilation, the **C.R.R.** will reach stage three meltdown, it is best to evacuate the area as the core is unable to be saved. The **C.R.R.** will begin to leak out rays that can injure personnel and damage the area around it. After a while, the reactor will blow up and leave behind a crater. ### Stall If you run out of C. Redstone or have 0% saturation, the reactor may begin to stall. Unlike the [S.T.F.R.](https://trotywiki.miraheze.org/wiki/STFR), this will not lead to the reactor freezing. It will then give you two options: remove the key and shut down the reactor or reignite the reactor again. ### Startup Failure There is a 5% change for startup failure to occur. If this does happen, this will start to cause the shield to form unstable, to prevent the **C.R.R.** from summoning a Resonance Cascade, you will need to kill the green particles that fly around the room. Once they have been all removed, the **C.R.R.** will return to normal operation. ## C.R.R. Logistics There is no limit for Core Temp but the higher it goes, the more Shield Stress is gained. Ender pearls increase F. Shield, Redstone increases C. Redstone, and Amethyst Blocks increase F. Catalyzer when it is low. ## Trivia The **C.R.R.** was inspired by the Anti Mass Spectrometer from the Half-Life series and the Dark Energy Construct from Garry's Mod. The **C.R.R** wasn't developed by Jona, instead it was coded by Cooocki and built by Kaiden"}
