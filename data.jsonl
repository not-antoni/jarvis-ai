{"text": "The OpenCore is a furnace that uses two positron emission units to remelt items many times more efficiently than basic methods. Use of OpenCore can consume from 1000MWh to 10000MWh. Multiblock Core Placement: Into the iron blocks at the bottom. Power Input: Into the conductor blocks. Note that the upper part is 4 blocks above the bottom part. To use OpenCore you need active S.T.F.R which produces more than 500 MWh (Varies depending on the recipe). Ingredient Energy (MWh) Result 8x Netherite Scrap 5000 8x Netherite Ingot 32x Glowstone Dust 2000 24x Blaze Powder 4x Emerald Block 7200 3x Diamond Block 20x Quartz 900 20x Amethyst Shards 4x Amethyst Block 6000 1x Ochre Froglight 1x Netherite Block 10000 1x Heavy Core. If you meet the requirements, you can start-up OpenCore and start using it. After confirming start-up sequence, you will start getting temperature orders you need to meet. You can find them at sign above centre of control panel. If you fail to meet order you will face consequences. If recipe was simple (froglight, amethyst shards, blaze powder) you will just get small explosion/photons, else, if there was difficult recipe (netherite ingots, diamond blocks, heavy core) you will get medium/large explosion.", "metadata": {"title": "OpenCore"}}

{"text": "The S.T.F.R. is a fusion reactor located in the Troty Energy Research Facility. The S.T.F.R. consists of 6 stabilisers, an encasing superstructure and the main core. The core consists of a shield layer and internal deuterium-deuterium based fusion core. The shield layer consists of one regenerative primary shield, one regenerative internal shield and three non-regenerative shields. The encasing superstructure is a sphere-like structure around the core. Heat generated during operation is transferred to the case, where coolant is boiled into steam and directed to turbines to generate power. The stabilisers keep the core stable. Breakers supply DC current for startup/restabilisation. AC input is at the bottom conductor; DC output at the top. The main computer connects machines and manages operations.", "metadata": {"title": "The_S.T.F.R"}}

Step 5: Press the SSTB button again to initiate reactor ignition. Common issues: Breakers may not work due to insufficient power or disconnected output. Ensure at least 24 MW power is directed to breakers.", "metadata": {"title": "S.T.F.R._Startup"}}
{"text": "S.T.F.R Stabilization controls. Stone buttons adjust Stabilizer Offset, Stabilizer Input, Power Lasers, Pressure Vent, Fuel Injection, and Cooling Lasers. Top buttons increase values, bottom decrease. Shield Stress includes Spin Stress, Pressure Stress, Heat Stress; Cold Stress and Ratio Stress affect reactor integrity. MSSR reduces stress from spin. Reactor panels show Fuel, Lubricant, Capacitor Charge, and Reactor Uptime. Overfueling or underfueling can destabilize core. Lubricant prevents maintenance. Power Surge multiplies control inputs by 10x during emergencies.", "metadata": {"title": "S.T.F.R_Stabilization"}}
{"text": "S.T.F.R. Restabilization. Critical Core states: Overload, Underload, Startup Failure. Overload: Reactor stats out of safety range; core can explode if MSSR reaches 0. Manual restabilization: Replace Stabilizer redstone lamps with Amethyst, press SSTB, use Stasis Laser with Netherite block. Follow mainframe and breaker steps within 3 minutes. Underload: Core colder than 8000°C; replace frozen Glowstone and press SSTB.
