After confirming start-up sequence, you will start getting temperature \"orders\" you need to meet. You can find them at sign above centre of control panel. If you fail to meet order you will face consequences. If recipe was simple (froglight, amethyst shards, blaze powder) you will just get small explosion/photons, else, if there was difficult recipe (netherite ingots, diamond blocks, heavy core) you will get medium/large explosion.

{"text": "The S.T.F.R. is a fusion reactor located in the Troty Energy Research Facility. The S.T.F.R. consists of 6 stabilisers, an encasing superstructure and the main core. This is the core of fusion reaction, where the main processes happen. This core is only present inside the superstructure when the reactor is in operation. The core consists of a shield layer and internal deuterium-deuterium based fusion core. The shield layer consists of one regenerative primary shield, one regenerative internal shield and three non-regenerative shields. The encasing superstructure is a sphere-like structure around the core of the reactor. As the core generates heat during operation, the heat is transferred to the case, where coolant is boiled into steam and directed to steam turbines to generate power. The stabilisers play a crucial role in keeping the core in a stable state and preserving the integrity of core shields. The breakers supply the S.T.F.R. with DC current. They are only needed during startup or restabilisation. AC current is input at the bottom conductor; DC is output from the top conductor. This pump pumps the coolant for the S.T.F.R. Used to operate the S.T.F.R. This is the main computer that connects most machines. Can be used to find out player IDs for Security Terminal. Used to connect and disconnect machines from the whole network. Upon heating up the reactor case, steam is produced and can be directed into turbines to generate power. Turbines have to be connected with steam pipes to the S.T.F.R. Turbines have to be connected with coolant pipes to the S.T.F.R.", "metadata": {"title": "The S.T.F.R"}}

Startup - Troty Energy Research Facility Please note that this page is WIP Keep in mind that this guide is written specifically for the official map, while most of the steps will be applicable for a custom built setup, a few steps are reserverd specificallly for the official map In the meantime, you can refer to this fan-made Quick start tutorial PDF Step by Step Guide on Startup: 1. Step - Turn the key lever on The lever tip must face down 2. Step - Press the SSTB button 3. Step - Switch to Reactor grid For this you'll need to go to the Main Facility Breakers room The correct configuration will be as shown on image 4. Step - Activate Core Breakers The breaker buttons should chance color to black and appear as pushed in 5. Step - Press the SSTB button again This will initiate reactor ignition and start the core Common issues you might encounter Breakers do not work This can be caused by insufficient power directed to the breakers as they need atleast 24 MW of power, alternatively could be caused by breaker output connnection not being connected to the S.T.F.R.

Type your article name above or create one of the articles listed here! S.T.F.R Stabilization S.T.F.R. Controls The operation of the S.T.F.R. can initially look complicated at first glace. Firstly, the image below is the general control area that you will operate the reactor. The stone buttons in the image above lower or raise the values on the signs above. From left to right, these buttons are connected to Stabilizer Offset, Stabilizer Input, Power Lasers, Pressure Vent, Fuel Injection, and Cooling Lasers. These will be explained in a moment. The top buttons increase the values and the bottom button decrease the values. The signs display what is the current status of the S.T.F.R. and the selected values of the stabilizer's operation. This picture is a status panel of a currently stabilized S.T.F.R. reactor. Going from the top, you see the top row shows the current status of parts of the S.T.F.R. this will show you if it is currently damaged, requires maintenance, or if there is currently any issues with it. The Shield Stress panel shows the three identifiable sources of reactor stress. Spin Strs or Spin Stress increases with the core spin, the stress increases exponentially when beyond 150,000RPM. Pres Strs or Pressure Stress increases with core pressure and decreased by MSSR. Heat strs or Heat Stress increases with Core Temperature and decreased by MSSR. not shown on this panel is Cold Stress and Ratio Stress. Cold Stress rises rapidly when the core temp is below 8,000°C. Ratio Stress is caused by the core pressure being less than twice the core temp. if all of these reach combined total 100% or more, the shield will begin to degrade, potentially leading to an Overload or Reaction Loss, see S.T.F.R. Restabilization if this occurs. The Shield Status panel shows the current state of the reactor's shield. S. Integrity or Shield Integrity and shows the integrity of the reactor's shield. MSSR or Magnetic Shield Stress Reduction, this increases by 1 unit for every 5,000RPM of core spin, during normal operations, MSSR decreases the amount of stress caused by core temp and core pressure. during a reactor overload, the core spin gradually decreases and thus MSSR will also slowly drop. once MSSR reaches 0 during an overload, a reactor meltdown can start, at which point you have about 60 seconds to flee or seek shelter before a massive explosion occurs. the Reactor Status panel shows the current state of the STFR. The Fuel panel has information about the reactor's fuel. Usage refers to how quickly the core is burning the fuel it has. it is recommended to match fuel usage to Fuel Injection after Core Pressure is mostly stable. S. Local or Stored Locally tells how much fuel is waiting for use in the stabilizers. this can be ignored as it is always 69,420. S. Core or Stored in Core tells how much fuel is inside the reactor's core. when below 500, core reactivity will drop, dampening the effects of the core's natural heating and the effects of the power lasers, potentially causing the core temp to drop uncontrollably. on the other hand, overfueling the core to 1,000 and beyond will cause any fuel beyond 1,000 to instantly turn into core pressure. in severe cases with fuel injection being massively above the fuel usage, the core pressure can rise rapidly. The Waste panel currently is not implemented and is not required to pay attention to. The Lubricant panel shows the current amount of lubricant that is in the S.T.F.R., naturally, there will be no lubricant unless you setup the Wet Mill and make Gold Slurry. Ensure that the Wet Mill is connected to the S.T.F.R. to add lubricant to the system. Lubricant prevents maintenance from occurring on the S.T.F.R. allowing you to do more activities while the S.T.F.R. is running without the worry of maintenance. Be aware that it does loose lubricant over time and you will need to input more lubricant into the system to prevent maintenance. The Capacitor Charge and Reactor Uptime panel shows how many Hours, Minutes, and seconds the S.T.F.R. has been running. the Capacitor Charge shows how full the capacitor is. the rate it charges goes up with Core Temp. If it is at 100%, you are able to do prepare a Power Surge pressing the ECPS or Emergency Core Power Surge, then you can confirm it by pressing the SSTB, which will start a 30 second countdown, after which, the surge will start and for 30 seconds, shield integrity will rapidly rise if below 100% and Stabilizer Offset", "metadata": {"title": "S.T.F.R Stabilization"}}
{"text": "S.T.F.R. Restabilization - Troty Energy Research Facility Create a new article Write your page text here: We currently have 18 articles on Troty Energy Research Facility. Type your article name above or create one of the articles listed here! S.T.F.R. Restabilization Introduction: This page will explain all types of Critical Reactor Core states and their Restabilizations. All Critical Core states are caused by failing Shield Integrity. Overload: An Overload is usually caused by Reactor Core stats being out of safety parameters. Once a Reactor Overloads, all Core stats will run out of control as the Stabilizers are no longer able to contain the Core. The Case will start burning from the Heat and the Core will start to shoot beams of light. After a while the Case will explode and radioactive particles will start filling the room. It is adviced not to touch these particles. If no action are taken during this time and the MSSR reaches 0, the Core can no longer be held back and will explode. How to prevent the core from exploding: Start the manual restabilization sequence by replacing the redstone lambs in the Stabilizers with Amethysts, then pressing SSTB at the console. Use the Stasis Laser by placing a Netherite block in it and then press the button on the Stasis laser. Manual Restabilization Sequence: With the Stabilizer lambs replaced by Amethyst you are now able to temporarly keep the core from exploding with an auxility shield. This shield lasts for 3 minutes before breaking. During this time several steps are needed in order to save your core and your entire base. The list must be done in order: Go to your mainframe and unlink the S.T.F.R. Controller from your S.T.F.R. Go to your breakers and activate them Don't forget to switch power grids if you are playing on the T.E.R.F. Map Go to your mainframe again and relink the Controller Replace the Amethyst back to Redstone lambs Press SSTB If all steps are completed within the 3 minute time window, well congratulations!, you can take a deep breath. However it's not over yet. The auxility shield must be compressed back to the regular reactor shield. For this the reactor will automatically initiate a Power Surge. During a Power Surge all controls are multiplied by 10x. That means you need to take extreme caution unless you want to end up with another Overload... If you cant complete all steps within the 3 minute time window, the reactor will resume its prior Overload state. You can no longer do a Manual restabilization Sequence and only the Stasis laser can save you now from certain doom. Underload: An Underload is caused by the core getting colder than 8000°C. This will cause exponential shield stress. Once the Shield Integrity is at 0%, it will cause the Core to collapse in on itself and the Stabilizers will get stuck in place because they froze due to the extreme cold. Initially this is not a threat, but it will be in due time if the Core is not reignited! If no actions are taken the Core shield will blow off which causes and unstopable explosion. Underload Restabilization: An Underload is easier to fix than an Overload. You will have to replace 5 of the now frozen Glowstone inside a Stabilizer with new Glowstone. If the Glowstone is replaced, press SSTB for a reignition power Surge. Once again keep in mind that the power surge multiplies your control inputs by 10x! Video coming soon:tm: Startup Faliure Restabilization: A Startup Faliure has a 2% chance to happen when starting up the Reactor. You will recieve 6 minutes to restabilize the Core. Restabilization can only occur if 4 Stabilizers are connected to the Turbine power grid. The end of each Stabilizer will need a power cable attached to it. Do not disconnect the cooling line because that would halt the power production you desperatly need. Stabilizer U and D currently do not have any connections they need and can be freely connected to. Your breaker input Stabilizer needs to be connected to and your mainframe connector input Stabilizer need to be connected. This also means your console will not work for the time being. Once all 4 Stabilizers are connected the reactor will automatically initiate a restabilization Power Surge. Do not forget to reconnect your Controller or you won't be able to control your reactor. Again, a Power Surge will make your controls multiply by 10x! Notes: Shield Integrity will rapidly decrease if all stabilizers are broken while the Reactor is online. During a Power Surge the Core will have 10x natural heating! Trivia: Underload is also reffered to as Freezedown/Reactor Stall by the Community but Underload", "metadata": {"title": "S.T.F.R.
