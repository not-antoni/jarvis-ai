{"title": "Hadron_Collider", "content": "The Hadron Collider is a machine in the TERF Facility, used to smash items into other items at high speeds to create new items. It is a major part of the Netherite Refining Process. Technicals: Multiblock Core Placement: Into the Interface Cauldron facing forwards Power Input: Into the Interface as seen in tutorial video Power Consumption(MW): ${ { Length\\times 16}}$. Build Tutorial: The Hadron Collider Interface is used to insert and extract items from the Hadron Collider. * Since the locations of other components depend on the location of the interface, it should be placed first (or planned for) and the location doesn't matter, as long as you have enough space for the rings. * The interface has many lightning rods sticking in towards the center, but only 1 facing out. Use this lightning rod to connect the interface to the Hadron Collider Terminal. * No, you cannot build multiple interfaces on a single collider like with the IRL Large Hadron Collider. That would be cheating. Additionally, a layer-by-layer build tutorial can be found here (https://imgur.com/a/gEIYTw8). Aside from the Hadron Collider Interface, the Hadron Collider also needs these copper rings to function * The rings need to be a one block big continuous (also referred to as \\\" wide\\\") tunnel between the two sides of the interface, made out of either copper coils or tinted glass. * The tunnel can go up or down, it doesn't have to stay on one layer. * The Hadron Collider requires at least 128 rings. Additional rings can be used to speed up recipe processing. To operate the Hadron collider, you need a Hadron Collider Terminal. * The terminal can be built anywhere, though it is recommended that you place it close by to your Hadron Collider Interface, so you can turn it on and off while also depositing items. * The Hadron Collider Terminal, unlike the STFR and DEM terminals, does not require a multiblock core or a mainframe connection. * To connect the terminal to the Hadron Collider, use a Data Connection to connect it to the collider interface.

{"title": "M.C.F.R.", "content": "The Modular Catalyzed Fusion Reactor (M.C.F.R.) is the first reactor that players make in TERF. It is a regular fusion reactor that generates Heavy Steam and Helium-4 through hydrogen-water reactions. Structure: One M.C.F.R. slab consists of four M.C.F.R. Assemblies. Inputs: Power for preheating, hydrogen input, water input, steam output. Warning: Missing any inputs/outputs can cause over-pressure, ventilation damage, and fatal explosions (explosion size scales with hydrogen amount). Helium-4 can be routed to tank or smokestack but requires proper disposal to prevent suffocation. Startup Process: Need multimeter, fluid ID, and syringes. Add 20,000 mB water, start electrolyzer for hydrogen, connect power cable for preheating (remove when hearing noise), wait for temperature to rise and drop, use syringe to remove water and raise hydrogen temperature. Takes ~30 minutes to produce Helium-4. Recommended Values per slab: 20,000 mB Water, 8,000 mB Hydrogen, 860°C Hydrogen. Maximum Values per slab: 30,000 mB Water, 10,000 mB Hydrogen, 1000°C Hydrogen, 2,500 mB Helium-4. Inspired by HBM's NTM ZIRNOX reactor based on MIRNOX reactor."}

{"title": "S.T.F.R._Restabilization", "content": "Introduction: This page will explain all types of Critical Reactor Core states and their Restabilizations. All Critical Core states are caused by failing Shield Integrity. Overload: An Overload is usually caused by Reactor Core stats being out of safety parameters. Once a Reactor Overloads, all Core stats will run out of control as the Stabilizers are no longer able to contain the Core. The Case will start burning from the Heat and the Core will start to shoot beams of light. After a while the Case will explode and radioactive particles will start filling the room. It is advised not to touch these particles. If no action is taken during this time and the MSSR reaches 0, the Core can no longer be held back and will explode. How to prevent the core from exploding: 1. Start the manual restabilization sequence by replacing the redstone lambs in the Stabilizers with Amethysts, then pressing SSTB at the console. 2. Use the Stasis Laser by placing a Netherite block in it and then press the button on the Stasis laser. Manual Restabilization Sequence: With the Stabilizer lambs replaced by Amethyst you are now able to temporarily keep the core from exploding with an auxiliary shield. This shield lasts for 3 minutes before breaking. During this time several steps are needed in order to save your core (and your entire base). The list must be done in order: 1. Go to your mainframe and unlink the S.T.F.R. Controller from your S.T.F.R. 2. Go to your breakers and activate them (Don't forget to switch power grids if you are playing on the T.E.R.F. Map) 3. Go to your mainframe again and relink the Controller 4. Replace the Amethyst back to Redstone lambs 5. Press SSTB If all steps are completed within the 3 minute time window, well congratulations!, you can take a deep breath. However it's not over yet. The auxiliary shield must be compressed back to the regular reactor shield. For this the reactor will automatically initiate a Power Surge. During a Power Surge all controls are multiplied by 10x. That means you need to take extreme caution unless you want to end up with another Overload... If you can't complete all steps within the 3 minute time window, the reactor will resume its prior Overload state. You can no longer do a Manual restabilization Sequence and only the Stasis laser can save you now from certain doom. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zHSilZ10vY Underload: An Underload is caused by the core getting colder than 8000°C. This will cause exponential shield stress. Once the Shield Integrity is at 0%, it will cause the Core to collapse in on itself and the Stabilizers will get stuck in place because they froze due to the extreme cold. Initially this is not a threat, but it will be in due time if the Core is not reignited! If no actions are taken the Core shield will blow off which causes an unstoppable explosion. Underload Restabilization: An Underload is easier to fix than an Overload. You will have to replace 5 of the now frozen Glowstone inside a Stabilizer with new Glowstone. If the Glowstone is replaced, press SSTB for a reignition power Surge. Once again keep in mind that the power surge multiplies your control inputs by 10x! Video coming soon:tm: Startup Failure Restabilization: A Startup Failure has a 2% chance to happen when starting up the Reactor. You will receive 6 minutes to restabilize the Core. Restabilization can only occur if 4 Stabilizers are connected to the Turbine power grid. The end of each Stabilizer will need a power cable attached to it. Do not disconnect the cooling line (Steam and water pipes) because that would halt the power production you desperately need. Stabilizer U and D currently do not have any connections they need and can be freely connected to. Your breaker input Stabilizer needs to be connected to and your mainframe connector input Stabilizer need to be connected. This also means your console will not work for the time being. Once all 4 Stabilizers are connected the reactor will automatically initiate a restabilization Power Surge. Do not forget to reconnect your Controller or you won't be able to control your reactor. Again, a Power Surge will make your controls multiply by 10x! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSJJZMk50MU Notes: - Shield Integrity will rapidly decrease if all stabilizers are broken while the Reactor is online. - During a Power Surge the Core will have 10x natural heating! Trivia: - Underload is also"}
{"title": "S.T.F.R._Startup", "content": "S.T.F.R. Startup provides a step-by-step guide for starting up the S.T.F.R. (Work in Progress, written specifically for official map). Step by Step Guide: 1. Turn the key lever on (lever tip must face down), 2. Press the SSTB button, 3. Switch to Reactor grid (go to Main Facility Breakers room for correct configuration), 4. Activate Core Breakers (breaker buttons should change color to black and appear pushed in), 5. Press the SSTB button again (initiates reactor ignition and starts the core). Common Issues: Breakers do not work (can be caused by insufficient power directed to breakers - need at least 24 MW, or breaker output connection not connected to S.T.F.R.).
