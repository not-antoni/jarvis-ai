All Critical Core states are caused by failing Shield Integrity. Overload: Usually caused by reactor core stats being out of safety parameters, causes all core stats to run out of control, case burns from heat, core shoots light beams, radioactive particles fill room, if MSSR reaches 0 core explodes. Prevention: Start manual restabilization by replacing redstone lamps with amethysts in stabilizers, press SSTB at console, use Stasis Laser with Netherite block. Manual Restabilization Sequence: Replace stabilizer lamps with amethyst (3-minute auxiliary shield), unlink S.T.F.R. Controller from mainframe, activate breakers (switch power grids if on TERF map), relink controller, replace amethyst back to redstone lamps, press SSTB. Underload: Caused by core getting colder than 8000°C, causes exponential shield stress, core collapses, stabilizers freeze, shield blows off causing unstoppable explosion. Restabilization: Replace 5 frozen glowstone in stabilizer with new glowstone, press SSTB for reignition power surge.
